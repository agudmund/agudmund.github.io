Endless fun battling opponents. Grows to infinity so you can brag to your friends and fiends alike. Pretty simple mechanics though. With a steady growth of browser based multiplayer games throughout the last decade there is a still a gap to be filled with longer lasting game boards. Bill the Bubble Head comes about as a three layer approach to filling that gap. While keeping in mind the longevity of the design. The immediate game is rather straightforward. Acts as a template towards a few variations of the same concept. Capture parts of the board, score points, on 3 minute intervals. The longevity mentioned, is achieved and explained much later if you keep browsing. For now, think of a gaming board, which grows perpetually. This would be where we focus and what this is all about. Let's start with some fundamentals though. Before we get to a point where a haptic hug makes sense in this context.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#intro","text":"Genesis 1:31 > It was very good, and there was evening and there was morning","title":"Intro"},{"location":"#_1","text":"Bill the Bubble Head presents itself as a board conquest game, designed for those who like to win by claiming it all.
